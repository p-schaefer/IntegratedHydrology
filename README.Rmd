Aquatic environmental scientists are often tasked with relating landscape factors to observed responses in streams, rivers and lakes. The computational workflow for conducting these investigations is complex. Simply describing how water flows and accumulates across the landscape can be a challenge itself, but for aquatic scientists it is only the first step. The stream network must then be extracted from the landscape, and reaches (a.k.a. segments; i.e., stretches of river between two confluences) identified and given unique identifiers. These reaches must then be attributed to be informative (e.g., slope, stream order, upstream channel length, etc.); and upstream-downstream connectivity between reaches established.

Typically, sampling data is available at points along the stream network. If the specific information about the location of these points is to be preserved (i.e., if samples are upstream and downstream of a particular effluent outflow, but along the same stream reach), they must be incorporated into the network. Once that is done, factors of interest on the landscape (e.g., landcover, soils, geology, climate, etc.) must be related to the reach (or sampling points). This alone can be complex as the spatial configuration of these factors relative to flow direction and accumulation are important. The ***ihydro*** package uses the ***hydroweight*** package to calculate these attributes.

The complexity of this workflow can be a rate limiting step in the scope, content, quality, and applicability of aquatic environmental scientist investigations. The ***ihydro*** package offers tools and workflows to simplify these complex steps. It is capable of handling all above computation steps, leaving researchers the task of identifying layers of interest and modeling with (potentially) large numbers of predictors.

The ***ihydro*** package also implements a novel form of describing spatial autocorrelation among sites. Due to the linear nature of flow in streams and rivers, autocorrelation tends to be asymmetric, with downstream sites potentially more similar to upstream sites when they are flow connected, than not flow connected (regardless of spatial proximity). ***ihydro*** produces an asymmetric matrix that describes the relationships between sampling points based on the proportions of an upstream catchment that is shared with a target site. Proportion of shared upstream catchment (rather than in-stream distance) is a more relevant measure of spatial autocorrelation in streams because it accounts for differences in catchment areas between points. For example, if water chemistry samples are taken from a large 6th order stream, and a upstream small 1st order tributary we would expect the small tributary to have only a small impact on the larger stream. Hence autocorrelation should be low because the tributary is not contributing much flow to the large stream. If using in-stream distances, the assumed autocorrelation may be high because the physical distance is small, but this would be incorrect.

***ihydro*** stores its geospatial products in a \code{*.zip} file for easy of retrieval and plotting in external software. It can be run in parallel for increased speed (if enough memory is available), and is quick at removing internal intermediate files to keep hard drives from filling up too fast.

## 2.0 System setup and installation

*WhiteboxTools* and *whitebox* are required for ***ihydro***. See
[whiteboxR](https://github.com/giswqs/whiteboxR) or below for
installation.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
## Follow instructions for whitebox installation accordingly
## devtools::install_github("giswqs/whiteboxR") # For development version
## whitebox is now available on CRAN
#install.packages("whitebox")

library(whitebox)

if (F){
  install_whitebox()
  # Possible warning message:
  # ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Could not find WhiteboxTools!
  # ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  #
  # Your next step is to download and install the WhiteboxTools binary:
  #     > whitebox::install_whitebox()
  #
  # If you have WhiteboxTools installed already run `wbt_init(exe_path=...)`':
  #    > wbt_init(exe_path='/home/user/path/to/whitebox_tools')
  #
  # For whitebox package documentation, ask for help:
  #    > ??whitebox

## 3.0 Prepare DEM and Sampling Points for for analysis

### 3.1 Generate toy terrain dataset and sampling points

Begin by bringing in the digital elevation model and using it to generate terrain products. The DEM must be processed in a way to remove depressions. Whitebox offers methods for breaching and filling DEMs to remove depressions. These tools must be run before applying ihydro tools. 

Another factor to consider at this step is whether to burn stream vectors into the DEM;  \code{whitebox::wbt_fillburn()} tool allows for this, but  there are several caveats associated with this process. See [here](https://proceedings.esri.com/library/userconf/proc99/proceed/papers/pap802/p802.htm#Trois)

# Many function in 'ihydro' can be run in parallel internally. However itâ€™s important to remember that
# data has to be passed back and forth between the workers. This means that whatever performance gain you might have
# gotten from your parallelization can be crushed by moving large amounts of data around. In general, passing objects
# as file paths will be faster than passing whole sf or terra objects. Not returning products directly will also speed
# up function processing time dramatically. Products can always be retrieved/read in directly from the output .zip
# file.

## 4.0 Generate individual geospatial analysis products

### 4.1 Process DEM with `process_flowdir()`

The process_flowdir() function starts the workflow and creates an output zip file which stores results.
It is important that functions are not run repeatedly with the same output file, as later
steps overwrite results from previous iterations.

This function generates d8 pointer, flow accumulation, and stream layers from the specified DEM, 
and flow accumulation threshold.

```{r, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 7, message = FALSE, error = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

output_filename<-file.path(save_dir,"Processed_Hydrology_sub.zip")


hydro_out<-process_flowdir(
  dem=toy_dem,
  threshold=1000L,  
  return_products=T,
  output_filename=output_filename,
  temp_dir=NULL, 
  verbose=T
)

flow_accum<-log(rast(hydro_out$dem_accum_d8.tif))

plot(flow_accum,main="ln-Flow Accumulation")

```

[Back to top](#Introduction)

### 4.2 Generate Subbasins `generate_subbasins()`

The `generate_subbasins()` generates subbasins for each reach identified in process_flowdir()

```{r, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 7, message = FALSE, error = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

hydro_out1<-generate_subbasins(
  input=hydro_out,
  return_products=T,
  temp_dir=NULL,
  verbose=F
) 

# Note polygons are identified with 'link_id' field which matches stream segments generated below

mapview(hydro_out1$subbasins,zcol="link_id")

```

[Back to top](#Introduction)

### 4.3 Generate Attributed Stream Lines `attrib_streamline()`



```{r, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 7, message = FALSE, error = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

hydro_out2<-attrib_streamline( 
  input=hydro_out1,
  extra_attr=c( # Additional attributes to calculate and add to outputs
    "link_slope",
    "cont_slope",
    "USChnLn_To",
    "Elevation",
    "StOrd_Hack",
    "StOrd_Str",
    "StOrd_Hort",
    "StOrd_Shr"
  ),
  return_products=T,
  temp_dir=NULL,
  verbose=F
)

# hydro_out2$links # Points containing pour points for each subbasins and upstream and downstream 'link_id's and 'extra_attr' fields

# hydro_out2$points # Points containing all points along the stream line, attributed with 'extra_attr' 

# hydro_out2$stream_lines # line segments for each subbasin, as well as and upstream and downstream 'link_id's and 'extra_attr' fields

mapview(hydro_out2$stream_lines,zcol="link_id")

### 4.4 Insert Sampling Points into Stream Layer `insert_points()`

```{r, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 7, message = FALSE, error = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

# Generate some artificial sampling points

points<-rast(hydro_out2$dem_streams_d8.tif) %>% 
  as.points() %>% 
  st_as_sf() %>% 
  filter(st_coordinates(.)[, 1] < 675000) %>% 
  rename(Sites=dem_streams_d8) %>% 
  .[c(10,12,50,100),] %>% 
  mutate(Sites=row_number()) %>% 
  st_jitter(5)

hydro_out25<-insert_points( 
  input=hydro_out2,
  points=points,
  site_id_col="Sites", # Column in points layer that corresponds to unique IDs that will be available in data products
  snap_distance=10L,
  return_products=T,
  temp_dir=NULL,
  verbose=F
)

# Segments get split at sampling points, with the most downstream segment retaining the original 'link_id' and 
# upstream segments getting increasingly larger decimal numbers

  mapview(hydro_out25$stream_lines,zcol="link_id",legend=F)+
  mapview(hydro_out25$links,zcol="link_id",legend=F)+
  mapview(hydro_out25$snapped_points,zcol="Sites",legend=F,color="red")
