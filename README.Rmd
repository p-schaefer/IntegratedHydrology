```

Aquatic environmental scientists are often interested in relating landscape features to observed responses (e.g., fish size, water temperature, invertebrate community composition, etc.) in streams, rivers and lakes. The computational workflow for conducting these investigations is complex. Simply describing how water flows and accumulates across the landscape can be a challenge itself, but for aquatic scientists it is only the first step. The stream network must then be extracted from the landscape, and reaches (a.k.a. segments; i.e., stretches of river between two confluences) identified and given unique identifiers. These reaches must then be attributed to be informative (e.g., slope, stream order, upstream channel length, etc.); and upstream-downstream connectivity between reaches established.

Typically, observed responses are measured at discrete sampling locations along the stream network. If the location information is to be preserved (i.e., if samples are upstream and downstream of a particular effluent outflow), they must be incorporated into the network. This is done by splitting stream lines and catchments at these points.

Once that is done, landscape features of interest (e.g., land-cover, geology, climate, etc.) must be related to the reach (or sampling points). This alone can be complex as the spatial configuration of these factors relative to flow direction and accumulation can be important (Peterson ***et al.***, 2011). The ***ihydro*** package uses  ***hydroweight*** (Kielstra ***et al.*** 2021) to calculate these attributes.

The complexity of this workflow can be a rate limiting step in the scope, content, quality, and applicability of investigations by aquatic environmental scientist. The ***ihydro*** package offers tools and workflows to simplify these complex steps. It is capable of handling all above computation steps, leaving researchers the task of identifying layers of interest and modeling with (potentially) large numbers of predictors.

The ***ihydro*** package also implements descriptions of spatial autocorrelation among sites. Due to the linear nature of flow in streams and rivers, autocorrelation tends to be asymmetric, with sites generally more similar when they are flow connected, than not flow connected. ***ihydro*** produces tables that can be transformed into a asymmetric matrices that describes the relationships between sampling points based on instream distances and/or the proportions shared catchments. Proportion of shared upstream catchment (rather than in-stream distance) are a more relevant measure of spatial autocorrelation in streams because it accounts for differences in catchment areas between points, as well as spatial proximity. For example, if water chemistry samples are taken from a large 6th order stream, and a upstream small 1st order tributary we would expect the small tributary to have only a small impact on the larger stream (despite its close physical proximity). Hence, autocorrelation should be low because the tributary does not contribute much flow to the larger stream. Using in-stream distances alone may misrepresent this pattern.

***ihydro*** stores its geospatial products in a zip file for ease of retrieval and extraction in external software (i.e. QGIS). Due to the compression involved, generating, and adding results to the zip file can be time consuming, however, many ***ihydro*** function can be run in parallel for increased speed (if enough memory is available). The functions are also quick at removing internal intermediate files to keep hard drives from filling up too fast.

## 2 System setup and installation

*WhiteboxTools* and *whitebox* are required for ***ihydro***. See [whiteboxR](https://github.com/giswqs/whiteboxR) or below for installation.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
## Follow instructions for whitebox installation accordingly
## devtools::install_github("giswqs/whiteboxR") # For development version
## whitebox is now available on CRAN
#install.packages("whitebox")

library(whitebox)

if (F){
  install_whitebox()
  # Possible warning message:
  # ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Could not find WhiteboxTools!
  # ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  #
  # Your next step is to download and install the WhiteboxTools binary:
  #     > whitebox::install_whitebox()
  #
  # If you have WhiteboxTools installed already run `wbt_init(exe_path=...)`':
  #    > wbt_init(exe_path='/home/user/path/to/whitebox_tools')
  #

## 3 Prepare DEM and Sampling Points for analysis

### 3.1 Generate toy terrain dataset and sampling points

Begin by bringing in the digital elevation model and using it to generate terrain products. 

```{r, message = FALSE, error = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
## Load libraries
library(ihydro)
library(tmap)
library(furrr)
library(whitebox)
library(terra)
library(sf)
library(dplyr)

# Many function in 'ihydro' can be run in parallel internally. However itâ€™s 
# important to remember that data has to be passed back and forth between the 
# workers. This means that whatever performance gain you might have gotten from
# your parallelization can be crushed by moving large amounts of data around.
# Not returning products directly will speed up function processing time 
# dramatically. Products can always be retrieved/read in directly from the
# output .zip file.

# Parallelization is done through the future package, so all parallel backends
# should be supported i.e.,:
plan(multisession(workers=8))

## Generate save_dir as a temporary directory
save_dir <- tempdir()


## Import toy_dem from openSTARS package
# devtools::install_github("MiKatt/openSTARS", ref = "dev")

ot<-system.file("extdata", "nc", "elev_ned_30m.tif", package = "openSTARS") %>% 
  rast() 

crs(ot)<-crs(rast(system.file("extdata", "nc", "landuse_r.tif", package = "openSTARS")))
writeRaster(ot,file.path(save_dir, "toy_dem.tif"),overwrite=T)

toy_dem<-rast(file.path(save_dir, "toy_dem.tif"))

## Identify some sampling points
system.file("extdata", "nc", "sites_nc.shp", package = "openSTARS") %>% 
  vect() %>% 
  st_as_sf() %>% 
  st_transform(st_crs(toy_dem)) %>% 
  vect() %>%

## 4 Generate geospatial analysis products

### 4.1 METHOD 1: With individual functions

#### 4.1.1 Generate flow direction/accumulation geospatial analysis products with `process_flowdir()`

The DEM must be processed in a way to remove depressions. Whitebox offers methods for breaching and filling DEMs to remove depressions. 

Another factor to consider at this step is whether to burn stream vectors into the DEM; ***ihydro*** impliments a simplified stream burning method that lowers the levation along the DEM by `burn_depth` meters. See  [here](https://proceedings.esri.com/library/userconf/proc99/proceed/papers/pap802/p802.htm#Trois) for more detailed approaches.

```{r, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 7, message = FALSE, error = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

# Outputs of all functions are always saved to output_filename by default,
# but can be included in function return with return_products=T (note this can
# be very slow for large regions)
output_filename_hydro<-file.path(save_dir,"Processed_Hydrology.zip")

# Generates d8 flow direction and accumulation, extracts streams at a specified 
# flow accumulation threshold
hydro_out<-process_flowdir(
  dem=toy_dem,
  burn_streams=system.file("extdata", "nc", "streams.shp", package = "openSTARS"),
  burn_depth=5,
  min_length=3,
  depression_corr="breach",
  threshold=100L,  
  return_products=T,
  output_filename=output_filename_hydro,
  temp_dir=NULL, 
  verbose=F
)

# hydro_out$outfile # -> This is the full file path of the resulting .zip file

# remaining outputs only present when `return_products` == T
# hydro_out$dem_final.tif # -> final dem after stream burning and depression correction 
# hydro_out$dem_d8.tif # -> d8 flow direction
# hydro_out$dem_accum_d8.tif # -> d8 flow accumulation (cells)
# hydro_out$dem_accum_d8_sca.tif # -> d8 flow accumulation (specific catchment areas)
# hydro_out$dem_streams_d8.tif # -> extracted streams at specified `threshold`

# if `return_products` == F, all produces are only available in the .zip file.
# Terra and sf allow access to files directly in the .zip file, whitebox
# requires them to be extracted to a folder

# List files present in .zip
fl<-unzip(list=T, # when list==T, contents are listed only, if F, they are extracted
          hydro_out$outfile)

fl

                           hydro_out$outfile, # Then specify the full path to the zip file
                           fl$Name[grepl("dem_accum_d8.tif",fl$Name)] # finally specify the file to extract

#### 4.1.2 Generate vector geospatial analysis products with `generate_vectors()`

This function combines `generate_subbasins()` and `attrib_streamline()` to produce a number of vector layers.

Typically, observed responses are measured at discrete sampling locations along the stream network. If the location information is to be preserved (i.e., if samples are upstream and downstream of a particular effluent outflow), they must be incorporated into the network. This is done by splitting stream lines and catchments at these points.

```{r, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 7, message = FALSE, error = FALSE, warning = FALSE}


# generates vector layers, including subbasins, stream lines, and links representing
# pour-points for each subbasin
hydro_out<-generate_vectors(
  input=hydro_out,
  points=file.path(save_dir, "sites.shp"), # These are optional
  site_id_col="site_id", # Column name in points layer that corresponds to 
  #                      # unique IDs that will be available in data products
  snap_distance=100L, # points that are more than 100m from closest stream are excluded
  break_on_noSnap =F, # default is to stop when any points don't snap, this will ignore that
  return_products=T,
  temp_dir=NULL,
  verbose=F
) 

# Several important columns are used throughout the vector layers:
# `link_id` - identifies reaches/segments (steam between two confluences)
# `trib_id` - identifies streams/tributaries, with the shortest channel getting
#           # a new trib_id at a confluence, and longest channel retaining the original ID
# `uslink_id` and `dslink_id`  - columns identify upstream and downstream links
# `ustrib_id` and `dstrib_id`  - columns identify upstream and downstream tributaries

# If 'points' are provided, this function modifies the vector outputs by inserting
# links, and splitting lines/subbasins at `points`. Inserted points are given "link_id'
# values that increment with decimal places from downstream to upstream directions 
# (i.e., 10.0 remains the pout point for the segment, and 10.1, 10.2,... identify
# sample points in an upstream direction). 

# New layers added by `generate_vectors()`
# hydro_out$db_loc       # -> sqlite database file path containing tables:
#                        #    "stream_links", "stream_points"
# hydro_out$subbasins # -> polygon subbasins attributed with `link_id` and reach
#                     #    contributing area (in m^2)
# hydro_out$stream_lines # -> line vectors attributed with `link_id`, `trib_id`, upstream
#                        #    and downstream link and trib IDS and a number of extra attributes
# hydro_out$points # -> point vectors along lines identifying 'nodes' (confluence
#                  #     points), vs 'links' segments joining 'nodes', and also
#                  #     attributed with `link_id`, `trib_id`, upstream
#                  #     and downstream link and trib IDS and a number of extra attributes
# hydro_out$links # -> point vector representing pour-points for subbasins,
#                 #   attributed with `link_id` and extra attributes
# hydro_out$snapped_points # -> provided points snapped to nearest segment. Any points 
#                          #   beyond snap distance are removed, with a warning if
#                          #   break_on_noSnap == F.

#### 4.1.4 Create lookup table of flow-directions with `trace_flowpaths()`

To more efficiently generate catchments, look-ups are created that identify the upstream and downstream links from each link. If `insert_points()` was run previously, inserted points are also included in lookups.


```{r, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 7, message = FALSE, error = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

#### 4.1.6 Examine pairwise distances 

For more complete and thorough treatment on spatial autocorrelation in stream systems, see [Zimmerman and Hoef (2007)](https://www.fs.usda.gov/rm/boise/AWAE/projects/NationalStreamInternet/downloads/17ZimmermanVerHoef_TheTorgegramForFluvialVariography.pdf).

Below we calculate pairwise distances between sampled areas. We take these distances and visualize them as heatmaps to illustrate how pairwise distance matrices can be used to represent spatial relationships among sites.

```{r, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 7, message = FALSE, error = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

  #                 #  which can be very slow for dense stream networks
)

# New data available in `pairwise_dist`
# pairwise_dist # -> tables of downstream path lengths between each pair of link_ids,

```

Using these relationships, we can perform a clustering analysis to identify groups of sites with potentially high spatial autocorrelation. These groups could for instance be used for cross-validation purposes.

```{r, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 7, message = FALSE, error = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

# Using the above approach, we create 5 groups of spatially proximate points
km<-(dmat*dmat2) %>% 
  dist("man") %>% 
  hclust() %>% 
  cutree(k=5)

gps<-tibble::enframe(km,"link_id","group") %>% 
  mutate(link_id=as.numeric(link_id))

point_groups<-hydro_out$snapped_points %>% 
  left_join(gps) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(group))

# These can be used for cross-validation purposes to see how well the models extrapolate outside of 
# sampled areas

tm_shape(hydro_out$subbasins) + tm_polygons(col="white",alpha =0.2,legend.show=F) +
  tm_shape(hydro_out$stream_lines) + tm_lines(col="blue",alpha =0.3,legend.show=F,lwd =2) +
  tm_shape(point_groups) + tm_dots(col="group", palette = "Dark2",legend.show=T,size=0.45)+
  tm_layout(legend.outside = TRUE)

```

Finally, we'll examine relationships among our response variable in terms of in-stream distances, contrasting flow connected sites vs, flow unconnected sites. Here we see greater differences between responses with increasing in-stream distance. We expect greater similarity among flow-connected than flow-unconnected sites, but don't see it here. This may be a product of this being an artificial data set.

```{r, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 7, message = FALSE, error = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

# get response variables
response_table<-file.path(save_dir, "sites.shp") %>% 
  read_sf() %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  select(site_id,value) %>% 
  left_join(hydro_out$snapped_points %>% # join by snapped sites to get link_id values
              as_tibble() %>% 
              select(site_id,link_id)) %>% 
  mutate(link_id=as.character(link_id))

# Combine pairwise data with values and examine spatial relationships. 
dmat<-hydro_out$pwise_dist %>% 
  filter(origin %in% sel_link_id$link_id &
           destination %in% sel_link_id$link_id
  ) %>% 
  # Add response values for origin and destination points into the table
  left_join(response_table %>% rename(origin_value=value),by=c("origin"="link_id")) %>% 
  left_join(response_table %>% rename(destination_value=value),by=c("destination"="link_id")) %>% 
  mutate(value_diff=sqrt((origin_value-destination_value)^2)) %>%  # Calculate the squared difference
  filter(origin!=destination) %>% 
  select(-dist_type,-site_id.x,-site_id.y,-origin_value,-destination_value) %>% 
  pivot_longer(c(directed_path_length,undirected_path_length,prop_shared_catchment,prop_shared_logcatchment),
               names_to ="dist_type",
               values_to ="dist") %>% 
  filter(!is.na(dist)) %>% 
  mutate(`Distance Type`=case_when(
    dist_type=="directed_path_length" ~ "Flow Connected",
    dist_type=="undirected_path_length" ~ "Flow Unconnected",
    dist_type=="prop_shared_catchment" ~ "Shared Catchment",
    dist_type=="prop_shared_logcatchment" ~ "Shared log-Catchment",
  )) %>% 
  distinct()

dmat

require(ggplot2)
ggplot(dmat %>% filter(dist_type %in% c("directed_path_length","undirected_path_length")),
       aes(x=dist,y=value_diff,col=`Distance Type`))+

  scale_x_log10(labels=scales::comma)+
  facet_wrap(~`Distance Type`)

```

Finally, we'll do a similar comparison but using percent of shared catchments. Here we expect pairwise differences to decrease as the percent of shared catchments increases.

```{r, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 7, message = FALSE, error = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

ggplot(dmat %>%
         filter(dist_type %in% c("prop_shared_catchment","prop_shared_logcatchment")) %>% 
         filter(dist>0),
       aes(x=dist,y=value_diff,colour=`Distance Type`))+

  theme(legend.position = "bottom")+
  ylab("Pairwise Value Difference")+
  xlab("Percent of shared catchments (Flow Connected only)")+
  scale_x_continuous(labels=scales::percent)+

### 4.2 METHOD 2: With a single function

output_filename_hydro_sparse<-file.path(save_dir,"Processed_Hydrology_sparse.zip")

## 5 Add layers of interest to geospatial analysis products with `process_loi()`

Layers of interest (loi) represent the features on the landscape we are interested in relating to the observed responses in the stream. These can include land-cover, climate, geology, soils, NDVI, slope, etc.

Instead of processing the loi separately (as was done above), they can instead be added to the completed workflow, and added to the existing .zip file for convenient file storage/organization. If run separately (as above), "num_rast.tif" and/or "cat_rast.tif" can manually be added to the .zip file as well.

```{r, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 7, message = FALSE, error = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

# In this case, we will use out previously calculated loi results, but if `process_loi` 
# is run with an input parameter specified, the loi rasters will be added to the
# output. This can make for convenient data storage.

if (F) {
  hydro_out<-process_loi(
    input=hydro_out,
    num_inputs=list(# Can be given as a mixture of input types (file paths, or any sf or terra format)
      slope=file.path(save_dir, "slope.tif")
    ),
    cat_inputs=list(# Can be given as a mixture of input types (file paths, or any sf or terra format)
      landcover=landuse_r_path,
      geology=geology_path,
      pointsources=pointsources_path
    ),
    variable_names=list( # any unlisted inputs will be used in their entirety
      geology="GEO_NAME",
      pointsources="pontsrc"
    ),
    return_products=T, # these layers can get large, and it is generally not advised to return them into R 
    temp_dir=NULL,
    verbose=F
  )
}

```

## 6 Calculate (weighted) spatial summaries:

New research is showing that the presence of particular features on the landscape is not always sufficient to predict the in-stream response to those features, and the location of those features relative to the locations of streams and areas of higher flow accumulation is very important (Peterson ***et al.*** 2011). 

***ihydro*** provides 2 functions for calculating weighted spatial summaries: `attrib_points()` and `fasttrib_points()`. `attrib_points()` uses the [hydroweight](https://github.com/bkielstr/hydroweight) package to calculate weighted spatial summaries of supplied loi layers. It can be used to examine the resulting distance-weighted rasters and distance-weighted loi layers. However, `attrib_points()` is very slow, so `fasttrib_points()` is available for improved performance for larger datasets. 

### 6.1 At specific sampling points with site specific attributes

The `attrib_points()` function can be run with a specification table to specify at which sites loi summaries should be calculated for, which loi to summarize, and type of numeric summary to use for those particular loi. 

```{r, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 7, message = F, error = F, warning = F}

# This retrieves loi names
loi<-list(numb=rast(loi_combined$num_inputs),
          cat=rast(loi_combined$cat_inputs))

loi_names<-lapply(loi,names) %>% unlist()
names(loi_names)<-loi_names

# Here we assign which summaries we would like calculated for each loi layer
loi_names<-map(loi_names,~c("distwtd_mean",  "mean", "distwtd_sd","sd",  "min", "max"))

# A 'spec' table can be given to calculate attributes at only select sampling points,
# and/or to only calculate a subset of attributes from select sampling points
specification_table<-tibble(
  site_id=c("1","25","80"),
  loi=list(loi_names)
)
specification_table$loi[[2]]<-specification_table$loi[[2]][c(1:2)]
specification_table$loi[[2]][[1]]<-specification_table$loi[[2]][[1]][c(1:2)]

attrib_points_time_small<-system.time(
  final_attributes_sub_slow<-attrib_points(
    input=hydro_out,
    loi_file=output_filename_loi, #output file path from process_loi()
    spec=specification_table,
    weighting_scheme = c("lumped", "iFLS", "iFLO",  "HAiFLO",  "HAiFLS"),
    OS_combine=F,
    target_streamseg=F, # This will set the target_o parameter as the sampling point
    inv_function = function(x) { # Function used by hydroweight to calculate
      # spatial weights across the landscape
      (x * 0.001 + 1)^-1
    },
    remove_region=NULL,
    return_products=T,
    temp_dir=NULL,
    verbose=F
  )
)


# Site 25 should only contain mean and distwtd_mean variables for slope
final_attributes_sub_slow %>%
  select(site_id,contains("slope"))

```

We can access the weighting layers and weighted attribute layers (if return_products==T) of the `attrib_points()` output.

```{r, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 7, message = FALSE, error = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

plot(
  rast(
    list(
      rast(final_attributes_sub_slow$distance_weights[[2]]$iFLS)%>%
        setNames("iFLS Weighting"),
      log10(rast(final_attributes_sub_slow$distance_weights[[2]]$HAiFLO))%>%
        setNames("log10-HAiFLO Weighting"),
      rast(final_attributes_sub_slow$weighted_attr[[2]][[8]]) %>%
        project(rast(final_attributes_sub_slow$distance_weights[[2]][[1]])) %>%
        setNames("iFLS Weighted Slope"),
      log10(rast(final_attributes_sub_slow$weighted_attr[[2]][[2]])) %>%
        project(rast(final_attributes_sub_slow$distance_weights[[2]][[1]])) %>%
        setNames("log10-HAiFLO Weighted Landcover Class 1")
    )
  ),
  col=viridis::viridis(101),
  axes=F
)

```

The `fasttrib_points()` function is a bit less flexible in its inputs, but is considerably faster for larger data sets, more loi, and more sampling points. For very small datasets `attrib_points()` may be faster.

```{r, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 7, message = F, error = F, warning = F}

fasttrib_points_time_small<-system.time(
  final_attributes_sub<-fasttrib_points(
    input=hydro_out,
    loi_file=output_filename_loi,
    sample_points=c("1","25","80"),
    out_filename="subsample_points_wgtattr.csv",
    link_id=NULL,
    weighting_scheme = c("lumped", "iFLS", "iFLO",  "HAiFLO",  "HAiFLS"),
    loi_numeric_stats = c("mean", "sd",  "min", "max"),
    inv_function = function(x) {
      (x * 0.001 + 1)^-1
    },
    temp_dir=NULL,
    verbose=F
  )
)


```

### 6.2 At all sampled points, comparing `attrib_points()` and `fasttrib_points()`

```{r, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 7, message = FALSE, error = FALSE, warning = FALSE}



final_attributes<-fasttrib_points(
  input=hydro_out,
  loi_file=output_filename_loi,

### 6.3 Across entire study area `fasttrib_points()`

In order to make predictions across the landscape, we will need to calculate our attributes across the landscape as well. We leave `sample_points` and `link_id` as NULL to predict across all reaches. At this point, we may also consider switching our target_o parameter from the sampling point (as was done above) to the entire reach by setting `target_o_type`="segment_whole". This will calculate all target_o weighting schemes to be the entire reach. This may be more conservative for predicting beyond sampling points as it integrates landscape factors across the length of the whole reach.

```{r error=FALSE, fig.height=12, fig.width=6, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# This function is optional. It will save the hydroweight rasters in the output zip file.
# These can be large and take up a lot of room, so consider whether they are needed before storing.
# Having the raster available does increase the computation time of fasttrib_points().

## 7 Example Modelling
### 7.1 Train a Random Forest Model

We'll finish off with a brief demonstration of how to use the geospatial products calculated above to build, and validate a predictive model. First we'll create a combined dataset:

```{r error=FALSE, fig.height=7, fig.width=7, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# As we will ultimately be predicting to our sparse landscape, we will only keep
# autocorrelation variables that are relevant to the sparse landscape. This would
# not necessarily be required if predicting to the more dense landscape.


# get response variables
response_table<-file.path(save_dir, "sites.shp") %>% 
  read_sf() %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  select(site_id,value) %>% 
  left_join(hydro_out$links %>%
              as_tibble() %>% 
              select(site_id,link_id) %>% 
              mutate(site_id=as.character(site_id))) %>% 
  mutate(link_id=as.character(link_id)) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(link_id))

head(response_table)

# Columns for spatial cross-validation
# Here we will use a matrix of directed path lengths to perform the
# spatial cross-validation:
clust_data<-hydro_out$pwise_dist %>% 
  filter(origin %in% response_table$link_id) %>% 
  filter(origin!=destination) %>% 
  select(-prop_shared_catchment,-undirected_path_length,-prop_shared_logcatchment,-dist_type) %>%
  rename(link_id=origin) %>%
  mutate(directed_path_length=ifelse(directed_path_length==1 | is.na(directed_path_length),0,directed_path_length)) %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  filter(directed_path_length!=0) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from=destination,values_from=directed_path_length ,values_fill = 0) %>% 
  data.frame(check.names = F) %>% 
  tibble::column_to_rownames("link_id")  %>% 
  log1p() %>% 
  tibble::rownames_to_column("link_id") %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  rename_with(.cols=c(everything(),-link_id),.fn=~paste0("CLUST_",.))

head(clust_data)

# Combine the data into a single dataset.
comb_data<-response_table %>% 
  left_join(
    final_attributes %>% mutate(site_id=as.character(site_id))   # replaces missing proportions with 0's
  ) %>% 
  left_join(
    hydro_out$pwise_dist %>%
      filter(origin %in% response_table$link_id) %>%
      select(origin,destination,prop_shared_catchment) %>%
      filter(origin!=destination) %>%
      rename(link_id=destination) %>%
      mutate(origin=paste0("Prop_catch_",origin))%>%
      mutate(prop_shared_catchment=ifelse(prop_shared_catchment==1 | is.na(prop_shared_catchment),0,prop_shared_catchment)) %>% 
      distinct() %>% 
      filter(prop_shared_catchment!=0) %>%
      pivot_wider(names_from=origin,values_from=prop_shared_catchment,values_fill=0)
  ) %>%
  left_join(clust_data) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(link_id)) %>% 
  mutate(across(starts_with("Prop_catch_"),~ifelse(is.na(.),0,.)))

head(comb_data)

```

Then, we'll follow the tidymodels workflow from here: [https://www.tidymodels.org/](https://www.tidymodels.org/). 

```{r error=FALSE, fig.height=6, fig.width=9, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#install.packages("tidymodels")
require(tidymodels)
#install.packages("recipes")
require(recipes)
#install.packages("spatialsample")
require(spatialsample)
#install.packages("ranger")
require(ranger)

# Define Model - tune 3 main parameters
rf_mod <- rand_forest(trees = tune(),
                      mtry = tune(),
                      min_n = tune()) %>% 
  set_engine("ranger",
             keep.inbag=TRUE,
             quantreg=TRUE,
             splitrule="extratrees", # for generally improved accuracy
             num.random.splits = 5
  ) %>% 
  set_mode("regression")

# Setup recipes, define column roles, and preprocessing steps
recip<-recipe(x=comb_data %>%
                select(-starts_with("CLUST_"),
                       -contains("site_id"),
                       -contains('link_id'))
) %>% 
  update_role(c(everything()),new_role="predictor") %>% 
  update_role(value,new_role="outcome") %>% 
  step_zv() %>% # remove variables with zero variance
  step_lincomb() # remove variables that are linear combinations of other 
#                # variables (can happen with proportional variables)

# Setup Cross-Validation Strategies
set.seed(1234)
cv_strats<-list(
  standard=vfold_cv(comb_data,v=5), # standard random leave group_out cross-validation
  spatial=spatial_clustering_cv(
    comb_data, # using spatial information to leave out groups of nearby stations
    cluster_function = "hclust", # hclust did a decent job clustering sites previously
    coords=colnames(comb_data)[grepl("CLUST_",colnames(comb_data))],v=5)
)

# Map hold-out data for each cross-validation fold
spatial_cv<-map2(cv_strats$spatial$splits,1:length(cv_strats$spatial$splits),function(x,y) {
  tm_shape(hydro_out$stream_lines)+
    tm_lines(col="blue",alpha =0.3,legend.show=F,lwd =2)+
    tm_shape(hydro_out$links[hydro_out$links$link_id %in% assessment(x)$link_id,]) +
    tm_dots(legend.show=F,size=0.3,border.col="black",border.alpha=1,border.lwd=1) +
    tm_layout(paste0("Spatial CV",y))
})

standard_cv<-map2(cv_strats$standard$splits,1:length(cv_strats$standard$splits),function(x,y) {
  tm_shape(hydro_out$stream_lines)+
    tm_lines(col="blue",alpha =0.3,legend.show=F,lwd =2)+
    tm_shape(hydro_out$links[hydro_out$links$link_id %in% assessment(x)$link_id,]) +
    tm_dots(legend.show=F,size=0.3,border.col="black",border.alpha=1,border.lwd=1) +
    tm_layout(paste0("Standard CV",y))
})

tmap_arrange(c(spatial_cv,standard_cv),ncol=5)

```

We see the spatial-cross validation hold-out sites cluster nicely together, whereas the standard cross-validation are randomly distributed across the region. Depending on the purpose of the model, we may favour one type of cross-validation over another. 


```{r error=FALSE, fig.height=7, fig.width=7, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# Setup final workflow
wf<-workflow() %>%
  add_model(rf_mod) %>% 
  add_recipe(recip)

# Run cross-validation strategies 

# tune_grid() can only work in parallel with the doParallel package
plan(sequential)

library(doParallel)
cl <- makeCluster(8)
registerDoParallel(cl)
set.seed(1234)

final_out<-map(cv_strats,
               ~tune_grid(wf,resamples=.,
                          grid=50  # Choose 50 hyper-parameter configurations
               ) 
)

stopCluster(cl)
# We expect the standard cross-validation to have higher accuracy than spatial
# cross-validation because the spatial autocorrelation variables should allow more accurate
# predictions from nearby sites. Conversely, the spatial cross-validation models
# show the best possible accuracy for predicting beyond the spatial extents of 
# Where the data was collected.

map_dfr(final_out,show_best,5,metric = "rmse",.id="Cross-validation strategy")

map_dfr(final_out,show_best,5,metric = "rsq",.id="Cross-validation strategy")

```

Next we build the final model. We will use the hyper-parameters that yielded the highest prediction accuracy using spatial cross-validation. The spatial cross-validation may provide better predictions as the distance from sampled areas increases, but with so few samples available in this data, it is difficult to evaluate that aspect of the model.

```{r error=FALSE, fig.height=7, fig.width=7, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# We will use rmse to select best metrics overall as it is better suited
# for model selection in this context than r^2

best_tunes<-map(final_out,select_by_pct_loss,1,metric = "rmse")

best_tunes

# Final ranger results
final_model<-finalize_workflow(wf,best_tunes$standard) %>% 
  fit(comb_data) %>% 
  extract_fit_engine()

# Overall observed vs expected leaves room for improvement, but is acceptable
# given the small data size and limited predictor consideration

tibble(
  Observed=comb_data$value,
  Predicted=predict(final_model,data=bake(prep(recip),new_data=comb_data))$predictions
) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=Observed,y=Predicted))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_abline(slope=1,intercept = 0) + 
  scale_x_continuous(limits=c(0,10))+
  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(0,10))+
  theme_bw()

```

Finally, we will use the model to predict across the whole landscape. First we'll assemble a table to predict from:

```{r error=FALSE, fig.height=7, fig.width=7, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

prediction_data<-final_attributes_all %>% 
  left_join(
    # Add spatial autocorrelation variables
    hydro_out$pwise_dist %>%
      filter(origin %in% response_table$link_id) %>%
      select(origin,destination,prop_shared_catchment) %>%
      filter(origin!=destination) %>%
      rename(link_id=destination) %>%
      mutate(origin=paste0("Prop_catch_",origin)) %>%
      mutate(prop_shared_catchment=ifelse(prop_shared_catchment==1 | is.na(prop_shared_catchment),0,prop_shared_catchment)) %>% 
      distinct() %>% 
      filter(prop_shared_catchment!=0) %>%
      pivot_wider(names_from=origin,values_from=prop_shared_catchment,values_fill=0),
    by=c("link_id")
  ) %>% 
  mutate(across(starts_with("Prop_catch_"),~ifelse(is.na(.),0,.)))

prediction_data
```

And finally, we can predict across the landscape. We'll use the range of quantile predictions to estimate uncertainty in the model predictions. The final map we produce here shows sampled points at their measured value, stream segments are coloured according to their predicted values, and the width of the stream segment corresponds to the uncertainty in the prediction.

```{r error=FALSE, fig.height=7, fig.width=7, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

prediction_tbl<-tibble(
  link_id=prediction_data$link_id) %>% 
  bind_cols(
    predict(final_model,
            data=bake(prep(recip),new_data=prediction_data),
            type ="quantiles",quantiles=c(0.25,0.5,0.75))$predictions %>% 
      as_tibble() %>% 
      setNames(c("p25","p50","p75"))
  ) %>% 
  mutate(`Uncertainty` = p75-p25,
         `Predicted`=p50) 

prediction_tbl

# Since we only have predictions for entire stream segments
# This will merge and breaks in stream lines
Streams<-read_sf(file.path("/vsizip",hydro_out$outfile,"stream_lines.shp")) %>% 
  mutate(link_id=floor(link_id)) %>% 
  group_by(link_id) %>%              
  summarize(geometry=st_union(geometry)) %>%
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(link_id=as.character(link_id)) 

Streams<-Streams %>% 
  left_join(prediction_tbl)

Points<-read_sf(file.path("/vsizip",hydro_out$outfile,"snapped_points.shp")) %>% 
  mutate(link_id=as.character(link_id)) %>% 
  left_join(response_table %>% select(-link_id)) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(link_id)) %>% 
  mutate(Observed=value)

tm_shape(Streams) + 
  tm_lines(col="Predicted",
           palette = "viridis",
           alpha =0.8,
           style="fixed",
           breaks =c(0,2,4,6,8,10),
           legend.show=T,
           lwd ="Uncertainty",
           scale=3) +
  tm_shape(Points) + 
  tm_dots(col="Observed", 
          palette = "viridis",
          legend.show=T,
          style="fixed",
          breaks =c(0,2,4,6,8,10),
          size=0.45,
          border.col="black",
          border.alpha=1,
          border.lwd=1)+
  tm_layout(legend.outside = TRUE)

```

We can also summarize the percent of stream lengths that fall within predicted value classes:

```{r error=FALSE, fig.height=7, fig.width=7, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

Streams %>% 
  mutate(strm_len=as.numeric(st_length(geometry))) %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  mutate(`Prediction Groups` = cut(Predicted, 
                                   breaks = c(0,2,4,6,8,10), 
                                   include.lowest=TRUE)
  ) %>% 
  mutate(total_strm_len=sum(strm_len)) %>% 
  group_by(`Prediction Groups`) %>% 
  summarize(`% of Total Stream Length`=sum(strm_len)/total_strm_len*100) %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x="",y=`% of Total Stream Length`,fill=`Prediction Groups`))+
  geom_bar(width = 1, stat = "identity")+
  coord_polar("y", start=0) +
  scale_fill_viridis_d()+
  theme_bw()

```

## 8 Future Plans

This package is considered in early alpha, and bugs are expected. There is lots of room for improvements in many of the functions. The core functions may still change as the package develops and matures.

* One big area of improvement will be the handling of the output .zip file structure.
* output .zip may be replaced by a spatialite database file.
* Many functions can be cleaned and optimized further.
