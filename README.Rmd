Aquatic environmental scientists are often interested in relating landscape features to observed responses (e.g., fish size, water temperature, invertebrate community composition, etc.) in streams, rivers and lakes. The computational workflow for conducting these investigations is complex. Simply describing how water flows and accumulates across the landscape can be a challenge itself, but for aquatic scientists it is only the first step. The stream network must then be extracted from the landscape, and reaches (a.k.a. segments; i.e., stretches of river between two confluences) identified and given unique identifiers. These reaches must then be attributed to be informative (e.g., slope, stream order, upstream channel length, etc.); and upstream-downstream connectivity between reaches established.

Typically, observed responses are measured at discrete sampling locations along the stream network. If the location information is to be preserved (i.e., if samples are upstream and downstream of a particular effluent outflow), they must be incorporated into the network. This is done by splitting stream lines and catchments at these points.

Once that is done, landscape features of interest (e.g., land-cover, geology, climate, etc.) must be related to the reach (or sampling points). This alone can be complex as the spatial configuration of these factors relative to flow direction and accumulation can be important important (Peterson ***et al.***, 2011). The ***ihydro*** package uses the ***hydroweight*** package (Kielstra et al. 2021) to calculate these attributes.

The complexity of this workflow can be a rate limiting step in the scope, content, quality, and applicability of aquatic environmental scientist investigations. The ***ihydro*** package offers tools and workflows to simplify these complex steps. It is capable of handling all above computation steps, leaving researchers the task of identifying layers of interest and modeling with (potentially) large numbers of predictors.

The ***ihydro*** package also implements descriptions of spatial autocorrelation among sites. Due to the linear nature of flow in streams and rivers, autocorrelation tends to be asymmetric, with sites generally more similar when they are flow connected, than not flow connected. ***ihydro*** produces tables that can be transformed into a asymmetric matrices that describes the relationships between sampling points based on instream distances and/or the proportions of an upstream catchment that is shared with a target site. Proportion of shared upstream catchment (rather than in-stream distance) are a more relevant measure of spatial autocorrelation in streams because it accounts for differences in catchment areas between points, as well as spatial proximity. For example, if water chemistry samples are taken from a large 6th order stream, and a upstream small 1st order tributary we would expect the small tributary to have only a small impact on the larger stream. Hence autocorrelation should be low because the tributary because it is not contributing much flow to the large stream. If using in-stream distances, the assumed autocorrelation may be high because the physical distance is small, but this would be incorrect.

***ihydro*** stores its geospatial products in a \code{.zip} file for easy of retrieval and plotting in external software. This can be one of the slower aspects of the functions, as it means output need to be compressed and added to the existing \code{.zip} file. Many ***ihydro*** function can be run in parallel for increased speed (if enough memory is available), and are quick at removing internal intermediate files to keep hard drives from filling up too fast.

## 3.0 Prepare DEM and Sampling Points for for analysis

### 3.1 Generate toy terrain dataset and sampling points

Begin by bringing in the digital elevation model and using it to generate terrain products. The DEM must be processed in a way to remove depressions. Whitebox offers methods for breaching and filling DEMs to remove depressions. These tools must be run before applying ihydro tools. 

Another factor to consider at this step is whether to burn stream vectors into the DEM;  \code{whitebox::wbt_fillburn()} tool allows for this, but  there are several caveats associated with this process. See [here](https://proceedings.esri.com/library/userconf/proc99/proceed/papers/pap802/p802.htm#Trois)

# Many function in 'ihydro' can be run in parallel internally. However itâ€™s important to remember that
# data has to be passed back and forth between the workers. This means that whatever performance gain you might have
# gotten from your parallelization can be crushed by moving large amounts of data around. In general, passing objects
# as file paths will be faster than passing whole sf or terra objects. Not returning products directly will also speed
# up function processing time dramatically. Products can always be retrieved/read in directly from the output .zip
# file.

## 4.0 Generate geospatial analysis products

### 4.1 METHOD 1: Individually

#### 4.1.1 Generate flow direction/accumulation geospatial analysis products with `process_flowdir()`

```{r, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 7, message = FALSE, error = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

# Outputs of all functions are always saved to output_filename by default,
# but can be included in function return with return_products=T (note this can
# be very slow for large regions)

# Generates d8 flow direction and accumulation, extracts streams at a specified 
# flow accumulation threshold
hydro_out<-process_flowdir(
  dem=toy_dem,
  threshold=100L,  
  return_products=T,
  output_filename=output_filename_hydro,
  temp_dir=NULL,

#### 4.1.2 Generate vector geospatial analysis products with `generate_vectors()`

This function combines `generate_subbasins()` and `attrib_streamline()` to produce a number of vector layers.

```{r, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 7, message = FALSE, error = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

plan(multisession(workers=4)) # improve processing time in some functions with parallel processing

# generates vector layers, including subbasins, stream lines, and links representing
# pour-points for each subbasin
hydro_out<-generate_vectors(
  input=hydro_out,
  return_products=T,
  temp_dir=NULL,
  verbose=F
) 

# Several important columns are used throughout the vector layers:
# `link_id` - identifies reaches/segments (steam between two confluences)
# `trib_id` - identifies streams/tributaries, with the shortest channel getting
#           # a new trib_id at a confluence, and longest channel retaining the original ID
# `uslink_id` and `dslink_id`  - columns identify upstream and downstream links
# `ustrib_id` and `dstrib_id`  - columns identify upstream and downstream tributaries

# New layers added by `generate_vectors()`
# hydro_out$subbasins # -> polygon subbasins attributed with `link_id` and reach
#                     #    contributing area (in m^2)
# hydro_out$stream_lines # -> line vectors attributed with `link_id`, `trib_id`, upstream
#                        #    and downstream link and trib IDS and a number of extra attributes
# hydro_out$points # -> point vectors along lines identifying 'nodes' (confluence
#                  #     points), vs 'links' segments joining 'nodes', and also
#                  #     attributed with `link_id`, `trib_id`, upstream
#                  #     and downstream link and trib IDS and a number of extra attributes
# hydro_out$links # -> point vector representing pour-points for subbasins,
#                 #   attributed with `link_id` and extra attributes

mapview(hydro_out$subbasins,zcol="link_id",legend=F,layer.name=".",alpha.regions=0.1)+
  mapview(hydro_out$stream_lines,legend=F,layer.name="..",lwd=2,alpha=1)+
  mapview(hydro_out$links,zcol="link_id",legend=F,layer.name="...",cex=2)
```

[Back to top](#Introduction)

#### 4.1.3 Split vector geospatial analysis products at sampling points `insert_points()`

Typically, sampling data is available at points along the stream network. If the specific information about the location of these points is to be preserved (i.e., if samples are upstream and downstream of a particular effluent outflow, but along the same stream reach), they must be incorporated into the network.

```{r, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 7, message = FALSE, error = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

# Optional step, inserts sampling points into stream vectors, splitting subbasins
# and lines at sampling points, additional links inserted at sampling points as well
hydro_out<-insert_points( 
  input=hydro_out,
  points=file.path(save_dir, "sites.shp"),
  site_id_col="site_id", # Column in points layer that corresponds to unique IDs that will be available in data products
  snap_distance=250L,
  return_products=T,
  temp_dir=NULL,
  verbose=F
)

# New layers added by `insert_points()`
# hydro_out$snapped_points # -> provided points snapped to nearest segment. Any points 
#                          #   beyond snap distance are removed, with a warning. 

# This function modifies the existing vector outputs by inserting links, and 
# splitting lines/subbasins at `points`, and adds the `site_id_col` column to 
# all vector outputs. Inserted points are given "link_id' values that increment
# with decimal places from downstream to upstream directions (i.e., 10.0 remains
# the pout point for the segment, and 10.1, 10.2,... identify sample points in
# an upstream direction). 

## !!IMPORTANT!!
# If you need to rerun insert_points(), you will have to run generate_vectors() again
# first to generate new vector layers to split.

mapview(hydro_out$subbasins,zcol="link_id",legend=F,layer.name=".",alpha.regions=0.1)+
  mapview(hydro_out$stream_lines,legend=F,layer.name="..",lwd=2,alpha=1)+
  mapview(hydro_out$snapped_points,zcol="site_id",legend=F,color="red",layer.name="....",cex=6)

```

[Back to top](#Introduction)

#### 4.1.4 Create lookup table of flow-directions with `trace_flowpaths()`

To more efficiently generate catchments, look-ups are created that identify the upstream and downstream links from each link. If `insert_points()` was run previously, inserted points are also included in lookups.


```{r, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 7, message = FALSE, error = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

# Creates lookup tables of upstream and downstream flow paths
hydro_out<-trace_flowpaths(
  input=hydro_out,
  return_products=T,
  temp_dir=NULL,
  verbose=F
)

# New layers added by `insert_points()`
# hydro_out$ds_flowpaths # -> named list of all link_ids, giving all downstream link_ids
#                        #    trib_ids, link lengths (in meters) and subbasin areas (in meters^2)
# hydro_out$us_flowpaths # -> named list of all link_ids, giving all upstream link_ids
#                        #    trib_ids, link lengths (in meters) and subbasin areas (in meters^2)

us_777<-hydro_out$us_flowpaths[["777"]] # get all upstream link_ids from link_id 777
ds_1107.1<-hydro_out$ds_flowpaths[["1107.1"]] # get all downstream link_ids from 
#                                             # link_id 1107.1 (this corresponds with site_id = 45)

lines_out<-hydro_out$stream_lines %>% 
  filter(link_id %in% us_777$link_id | 
           link_id %in% ds_1107.1$link_id 
  )
sub_out<-hydro_out$subbasins %>% 
  filter(link_id %in% us_777$link_id | 
           link_id %in% ds_1107.1$link_id
  )

mapview(sub_out,zcol="link_id",legend=F,layer.name=".",alpha.regions=0.3)+
  mapview(lines_out,legend=F,layer.name="..",lwd=2,alpha=1)

```

[Back to top](#Introduction)

#### 4.1.5 Generate complete upstream catchment areas with `get_catchment()`

```{r, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 7, message = FALSE, error = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

# Once lookup tables are calculated (not necessarily returned, can be return_products = F),
# catchments can easily be retrieved:

subbasin_catchments<-get_catchment( # retrieve catchment for an arbitrary reach
  input=hydro_out,
  site_id_col=NULL,
  target_points=c("838")
)

point_catchments<-get_catchment( # retrieve sampling point catchments
  input=hydro_out,
  site_id_col="site_id",
  target_points=c("1","25")
)

mapview(hydro_out$stream_lines,legend=F,layer.name="..",lwd=2,alpha=1)+
  mapview(point_catchments,zcol="link_id",legend=F, color = "black", lwd = 5,alpha.regions=0.8,layer.name="...")+
  mapview(subbasin_catchments,zcol="link_id",legend=F, color = "Yellow", lwd = 5,alpha.regions=0.8,layer.name="....")

#### 4.1.6 Generate pairwise distances with `generate_pwisedist()`

For more complete and thorough treatment on spatial autocorrelation in stream systems, see Zimmerman and Hoef (2007).

Below we calculate pairwise distances between sampled areas. We take these distances and visualize them as heatmaps to illustrate how pairwise distance matrices can be used to represent spatial relationships among sites.

```{r, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 7, message = FALSE, error = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

hydro_out<-generate_pwisedist(
  input=hydro_out,
  return_products=T,
  temp_dir=NULL,
  verbose=F
)

# New layers added by `generate_pwisedist()`
# hydro_out$pwise_dist # -> table of downstream path lengths between each pair of link_ids,
#                                 #    with flow-connected in-stream distances (directed_path_length),
#                                 #    flow-unconnected in-stream distances (undirected_path_length),
#                                 #    and proportions of shared catchments (prop_shared_catchment)


# Examine relationships among sampled sites. 

# Get link_id for sampled points
sel_link_id<-hydro_out$snapped_points 

# filter long table to selected sites, and convert to wide format
dmat<-hydro_out$pwise_dist %>% 
  filter(origin %in% sel_link_id$link_id &
           destination %in% sel_link_id$link_id
  ) %>% 
  filter(origin!=destination) %>% 
  select(-prop_shared_catchment,-undirected_path_length) %>%
  rename(link_id=origin) %>%
  select(-origin_catchment,-destination_catchment) %>%
  mutate(directed_path_length=ifelse(directed_path_length==1 | is.na(directed_path_length),0,directed_path_length)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from=destination,values_from=directed_path_length ,values_fill = 0) %>% 
  data.frame(check.names = F) %>% 
  tibble::column_to_rownames("link_id") 

dmat %>% 
  log1p() %>% 
  dist("manhattan") %>% 
  as.matrix() %>% 
  heatmap()

```

Using these relationships, we can perform a clustering analysis to identify groups of sites with potentially high spatial autocorrelation. These groups could for instance be used for cross-validation purposes.

```{r, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 7, message = FALSE, error = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

# Using path lengths allows the identification of groups of spatially proximate
# site, these can be used for cross-validation groups
km<-dmat %>% 
  log1p() %>% 
  dist("manhattan") %>% 
  hclust() %>% 
  cutree(k=5)

gps<-tibble::enframe(km,"link_id","group") %>% 
  mutate(link_id=as.numeric(link_id))

point_groups<-hydro_out$snapped_points %>% 
  left_join(gps) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(group))

mapview(hydro_out$subbasins,zcol="link_id",legend=F,layer.name=".",alpha.regions=0.1)+
  mapview(hydro_out$stream_lines,legend=F,layer.name="..",lwd=2,alpha=1)+
  mapview(point_groups,zcol="group",legend=F,color="red",layer.name="....",cex=6)

```

Finally, we'll examine relationships among our response variable in terms of in-stream distances, contrasting flow connected sites vs, flow unconnected sites. Here we see greater differences between responses with increasing in-stream distance. Within the first 10,000m (10km) range, response values are more similar in flow connected sites, than flow unconnected.

```{r, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 7, message = FALSE, error = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

# get response variables
response_table<-file.path(save_dir, "sites.shp") %>% 
  read_sf() %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  select(site_id,value) %>% 
  left_join(hydro_out$snapped_points %>%
              as_tibble() %>% 
              select(site_id,link_id)) %>% 
  mutate(link_id=as.character(link_id))

# Combine pairwise data with values and examine spatial relationships. For more 
# precise version, see:
# https://www.fs.usda.gov/rm/boise/AWAE/projects/NationalStreamInternet/downloads/17ZimmermanVerHoef_TheTorgegramForFluvialVariography.pdf

dmat<-hydro_out$pwise_dist %>% 
  filter(origin %in% sel_link_id$link_id &
           destination %in% sel_link_id$link_id
  ) %>% 
  # select(-directed_path_length,-undirected_path_length) %>%

## 7.0 Example Model
### 7.1 Train a Random Forest Model

We'll finish off with a brief demonstration of how to use the geospatial products calculated above to build, and validate a predictive model. First we'll create a combined dataset:

```{r error=FALSE, fig.height=7, fig.width=7, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# As we will ultimately be predicting to our sparse landscape, we will only keep
# autocorrelation variables that are relevant to the sparse landscape. This would
# not necessarily be required if predicting to the more dense landscape.


# get response variables
response_table<-file.path(save_dir, "sites.shp") %>% 
  read_sf() %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  select(site_id,value) %>% 
  left_join(hydro_out$snapped_points %>%
              as_tibble() %>% 
              select(site_id,link_id)) %>% 
  mutate(link_id=as.character(link_id))

sub_tbl<-read_sf(file.path("/vsizip",hydro_out_sparse$outfile,"snapped_points.shp"))

sub_id_keep<-response_table %>% 
  filter(site_id %in% sub_tbl$site_id)

# Columns for spatial cross-validation
clust_data<-hydro_out$pwise_dist %>% 
  filter(origin %in% response_table$link_id &
           destination %in% sub_id_keep$link_id
  ) %>% 
  filter(origin!=destination) %>% 
  select(-prop_shared_catchment,-undirected_path_length) %>%
  rename(link_id=origin) %>%
  select(-origin_catchment,-destination_catchment) %>%
  mutate(directed_path_length=ifelse(directed_path_length==1 | is.na(directed_path_length),0,directed_path_length)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from=destination,values_from=directed_path_length ,values_fill = 0) %>% 
  data.frame(check.names = F) %>% 
  tibble::column_to_rownames("link_id")  %>% 
  log1p() %>% 
  tibble::rownames_to_column("link_id") %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  rename_with(.cols=c(everything(),-link_id),.fn=~paste0("CLUST_",.))

# Combine the data into a single dataset.
comb_data<-response_table %>% 
  left_join(final_attributes_samples %>%
              select(-distance_weights,-weighted_attr) %>% 
              mutate(across(c(everything(),-site_id),as.numeric)) %>% 
              mutate(across(ends_with("_prop"),~case_when(is.na(.) | is.nan(.) ~ 0, T ~ .)))   # replaces missing proportions with 0's
  ) %>% 
  left_join(
    hydro_out$pwise_dist %>%
      filter(origin %in% sub_id_keep$link_id &
               destination %in% response_table$link_id
      ) %>%
      select(origin,destination,prop_shared_catchment) %>%
      filter(origin!=destination) %>%
      rename(link_id=destination) %>%
      mutate(origin=paste0("Prop_catch_",origin)) %>%
      pivot_wider(names_from=origin,values_from=prop_shared_catchment,values_fill=0)
  ) %>%
  left_join(clust_data)

```

Then, we'll follow the tidymodels workflow from here: [https://www.tidymodels.org/](https://www.tidymodels.org/). 

```{r error=FALSE, fig.height=7, fig.width=7, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#install.packages("tidymodels")
require(tidymodels)
#install.packages("recipes")
require(recipes)
#install.packages("spatialsample")
require(spatialsample)
#install.packages("ranger")
require(ranger)

# Define Model - tune 3 main parameters
rf_mod <- rand_forest(trees = tune(),
                      mtry = tune(),
                      min_n = tune()) %>% 
  set_engine("ranger",
             keep.inbag=TRUE,
             quantreg=TRUE,
             splitrule="extratrees", # for generally improved performance
             num.random.splits = 5
  ) %>% 
  set_mode("regression")

# Setup recipes, define column roles, and preprocessing steps
recip<-recipe(x=comb_data %>%
                select(-starts_with("CLUST_"),-contains("site_id"),-contains('link_id'))
) %>% 
  update_role(c(everything()),new_role="predictor") %>% 
  update_role(value,new_role="outcome") %>% 
  step_zv() %>% # remove variables with near zero variance
  step_lincomb() # remove variables that are linear combinations of other variables

# Setup Cross-Validation Strategies
set.seed(1234)
cv_strats<-list(
  standard=vfold_cv(comb_data,v=5), # standard leave group_out cross-validation
  spatial=spatial_clustering_cv(comb_data, # using spatial information to leave out groups of nearby stations
                                cluster_function = "hclust", # hclust did a decent job clustering sites previously
                                coords=colnames(comb_data)[grepl("CLUST_",colnames(comb_data))],v=5)
)

# Setup final workflow
wf<-workflow() %>%
  add_model(rf_mod) %>% 
  add_recipe(recip)

# Run cross-validation strategies 
set.seed(1234)
final_out<-future_map(cv_strats,
                      ~tune_grid(wf,resamples=.,grid=50)
)

# We expect the standard cross-validation to have higher accuracy than spatial
# cross-validation because the spatial autocorrelation variables should allow more accurate
# predictions from nearby sites

map_dfr(final_out,show_best,5,metric = "rmse",.id="Cross-validation strategy")

```

Next we build the final model. We will use the hyper-parameters that yielded the highest prediction accuracy using standard cross-validation. The spatial cross-validation may provide better predictions as the distance from sampled areas increases, but with so few samples available in this data, it is difficult to evaluate that aspect of the model.

```{r error=FALSE, fig.height=7, fig.width=7, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# Will use rmse to select best metrics overall as it is better suited
# for model selection in this context

best_tunes<-map(final_out,select_best,1,metric = "rmse")

# Final ranger results
final_model<-finalize_workflow(wf,best_tunes$standard) %>% 
  fit(comb_data) %>% 
  extract_fit_engine()

# Overall observed vs expected leaves room for improvement, but is acceptable
# given the small data size and limited predictor consideration

tibble(
  Observed=comb_data$value,
  Predicted=predict(final_model,data=bake(prep(recip),new_data=comb_data))$predictions
) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=Observed,y=Predicted))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_abline(slope=1,intercept = 0) + 
  scale_x_continuous(limits=c(0,10))+
  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(0,10))+
  theme_bw()

```

Finally, we will use the model to predict across our sparse landscape. The first step is to create a lookup table of link_ids between the two landscapes, as link_ids are specific to the stream initiation threshold.

```{r error=FALSE, fig.height=7, fig.width=7, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# link_ids won't match between the sparese and full landscapes, so need to make a lookup table
# to combine the link_ids

lkp<-read_sf(file.path("/vsizip",hydro_out_sparse$outfile,"stream_links.shp")) %>% 
  select(site_id,link_id) %>% 
  rename(sparse_link_id=link_id) %>% 
  st_join(hydro_out$links %>% select(link_id) %>%  rename(comp_link_id=link_id))

mapview(read_sf(file.path("/vsizip",hydro_out_sparse$outfile,"Subbasins_poly.shp")),
        zcol="link_id",legend=F,layer.name=".",alpha.regions=0.1)+
  mapview(read_sf(file.path("/vsizip",hydro_out_sparse$outfile,"stream_lines.shp")),
          legend=F,layer.name="..",lwd=2,alpha=1)+
  mapview(read_sf(file.path("/vsizip",hydro_out_sparse$outfile,"stream_links.shp")),zcol="link_id",
          legend=F,layer.name="...",cex=2)+
  mapview(lkp,zcol="comp_link_id")

```

We now need to build a data set for our prediction sites.

```{r error=FALSE, fig.height=7, fig.width=7, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

prediction_data<-lkp %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  mutate(comp_link_id=as.character(comp_link_id)) %>% 
  select(link_id=sparse_link_id,comp_link_id,site_id) %>% 
  left_join(
    final_attributes_all %>%
      select(-distance_weights,-weighted_attr) %>% 
      mutate(across(c(everything()),as.numeric)) %>% 
      mutate(across(ends_with("_prop"),~case_when(is.na(.) | is.nan(.) ~ 0, T ~ .)))
  ) %>% 
  left_join(
    hydro_out$pwise_dist %>%
      filter(origin %in% sub_id_keep$link_id) %>%
      select(origin,destination,prop_shared_catchment) %>%
      filter(origin!=destination) %>%
      rename(link_id=destination) %>%
      mutate(origin=paste0("Prop_catch_",origin)) %>%
      pivot_wider(names_from=origin,values_from=prop_shared_catchment,values_fill=0),
    by=c("comp_link_id"="link_id")
  ) %>% 
  filter(!if_any(c(contains("Prop_catch"),contains("HAiFLO")),is.na))

```

And finally, we can predict across the landscape. We'll use the range of quantile predictions to estimate uncertainty in the model predictions. The final map we produce here shows sampled points at thier measured value, stream segments are coloured according to their predictied values, and the width of the stream segment corresponds to the uncertainty in the prediction.

```{r error=FALSE, fig.height=7, fig.width=7, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

prediction_tbl<-tibble(
  link_id=prediction_data$link_id) %>% 
  bind_cols(
    predict(final_model,
            data=bake(prep(recip),new_data=prediction_data),
            type ="quantiles",quantiles=c(0.25,0.5,0.75))$predictions %>% 
      as_tibble() %>% 
      setNames(c("p25","p50","p75"))
  ) %>% 
  mutate(`Prediction Confidence` = p75-p25,
         `Predicted`=p50)

Streams<-read_sf(file.path("/vsizip",hydro_out_sparse$outfile,"stream_lines.shp")) %>% 
  mutate(link_id=floor(link_id)) %>% #this will assign the predicted value to the entire reach,
  #not just the unsampled portion
  left_join(prediction_tbl)

Points<-read_sf(file.path("/vsizip",hydro_out_sparse$outfile,"snapped_points.shp")) %>% 
  mutate(link_id=as.character(link_id)) %>% 
  left_join(response_table %>% select(-link_id)) %>% 
  mutate(Observed=value)

if(F) {
  mapview(Streams,zcol="Predicted",lwd="Prediction Confidence")+
    mapview(Points,zcol="Observed")
}

```

## 8.0 Future Plans

This package is considered in early alpha, and bugs are expected. There is lots of room for improvements in many of the functions. The core functions may still change as the package develops and matures.
