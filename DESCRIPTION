Description: Implements tools to simplify workflows associated with geospatial
    analysis of aquatic systems. Uses user defined Digital Elevation
    Models (DEM) to produce attributed stream line vectors, catchment and subcatchment 
    polygones, and pairwise distances among stream segments.
